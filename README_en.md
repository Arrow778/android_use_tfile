# Usage Guide

## Preface

> Most of the code used for training this model was generated by AI (Qwen and **Gemini 3 Pro**). My main contribution was collecting the dataset:  
> - The `dog` and `cat` images were sourced from **Kaggle**.  
> - All other class images were collected via image search on **Baidu** and **Bing**.
>
> ⚠️ **Note**: This training script uses **GPU acceleration**. Therefore, you must have **CUDA** and **cuDNN** properly installed and compatible with your GPU.  
> If your machine does **not support GPU training**, please ask an AI to generate a CPU-only version of the training script.

## Environment

- **Python version**: `3.8.20` (your Python version must be **≥ 3.8.20**)
- It is **highly recommended** to create a dedicated virtual environment to avoid polluting your system-wide Python setup.

After creating and activating your virtual environment, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## File Descriptions

> - `datasets/` — Folder containing all training data  
> - `change_file_name.py` — Renames files inside `datasets/train_1/xxx/` subdirectories  
> - `check_img.py` — Validates whether images in `datasets/train_1/xxx/` are suitable for training (e.g., checks for corruption)  
> - `split_test_dataset.py` — Splits a portion of the training data into a test set; **required before running `predict_test_model.py`**  
> - `predict_test_model.py` — Evaluates the trained model on the test set  
> - `train_main.py` — Main training script  
> - `models/` — Directory to store exported models (will be created automatically if missing)  
> - `labels/` — Directory to store label files (e.g., `label-mutil.txt`; will be created automatically if missing)

## Android Integration

- Your Android project must target **API level > 34**.
- When creating a new project in Android Studio, select **"No Activity"**.
- Then, replicate the project structure based on the provided example: **`MyApplication3`**.
